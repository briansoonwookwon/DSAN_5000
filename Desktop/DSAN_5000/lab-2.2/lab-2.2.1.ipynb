division arising during the normalization equation. \n","\n","This also forces the data into a standard range of roughly [-3 to 3] while still preserving the \"shape\" of the data.\n","\n","Often, when training machine learning models, it is important to normalize the data first. \n","\n","The model will have a much easier time \"fitting\" if every input is in a standard range of [-3 to
